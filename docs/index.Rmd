## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become our project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, we will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## Summary information

```

Tobacco harm is one of the serious public health problems in the world today. From a dataset which contains the prevalence and trends of tobacco use for 1995-2010 In United States, a large percentage of people in 876 states and areas currently smoke tobacco or have previously smoked it. This leads to health risks for many people. According to the data of brain stroke, 776 smoking people of 4981 observations get brain stroke. Numerous scientific evidence show that smoking seriously harms human health and causes many diseases such as heart disease and hypertension. One of the most important reasons for the difficulty of suppressing the harm of tobacco is the high taxation from the tobacco industry. From the perspective of tobacco production in various countries, China is far ahead of all countries in the world, with an output of 2,298.8 thousand tons. Based on the huge population and high profits, no government or country wants to give up this stable fiscal revenue. Therefore, for the health of themselves and those around them, people can only spontaneously take actions such as quitting smoking and promoting the harm of smoking.

## Table
```{r creates a table of summary information}
source("https://github.com/info201b-au2022/project-Wyd912263554/blob/main/source/Table.R")
cigarette_group
```

This table was included to illustrate the percentages of populations that smoked in a given state or location in our data. We aimed to give the reader a good  visual perception of percentages of populations that recorded smoking across 2019 to 2020. In doing so we hoped to illustrate the changes in smoking behavior that may have occured across the given time period. We combined two data sets with information regarding smoking percentage demographics to come to this summary table. By sorting the percentage of non-smokers in 2020 in an ascending order you are able to see the states with the highest percentage population of smokers. It in interesting to note that state
with the highest percentage of smokers in 2020 was Nevada and the state with the lowest percentage
of its population being smokers in 2020 was Utah. It could be intruiging to explore some of the 
underlying causes of these differences from different key standpoints such as culture to economy.

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example: Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r chart_1, echo=FALSE}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/info201b-au2022/project-Wyd912263554/main/source/Chart%201.R")
plot(chart_1)
```

For the data set about the tobacco industry, we choose to use the bar graph. The purpose of using this data set is to show how much the tobacco industry weighs in our country. According to the chart, America is one of the countries that produce a high amount of tobacco; from the chart, the United States is in 4th place among all the ten countries. 

```{r chart_2, echo=FALSE}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/info201b-au2022/project-Wyd912263554/main/source/Chart%202.R")
plot(chart_2)
```

For the data set about Tobacco use between 1995 to 2010, we use the plot to find the percentile of people who smoked every day in Washington state. The purpose of using this plot is to see the tobacco use trend from 1995 to 2010. Even though the chart shows a decline (the never smoking rate in 1995 was about 17.5%, and the never smoking rate in 2010 was approximately 11%), the percentage of people who smoke tobacco in Washington state is very high. The best year in the chart is 2009, and in that year there are still 10.7% of the people in Washington state smoked every day.

```{r chart_3, echo=FALSE}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/info201b-au2022/project-Wyd912263554/main/source/Chart%203.R")
plot(chart_3)
```

For the data set about Tobacco use between 1995 to 2010, we use the scatter plot to find the percentile of people who never smoked in Washington state. The purpose of using this plot is to see the tobacco use trend from 1995 to 2010. Even though the chart shows a progression (the never smoking rate in 1995 was about 50.2%, and the never smoking rate in 2010 was approximately 59.3%), the percentage of people who had experience with tobacco in Washington state is still insane. The best never-smoking rate in Washington state is about 59.3%, which means there are still about 40% of people who have experienced smoking at the best of the year.
