## Abstract:

Our main question is how tobacco use affects people and how we can control the demand for tobacco in the country. This question is vital because the tobacco epidemic is one of the biggest public health threats that we're facing. To address this question, we will analyze datasets containing tobacco use trends for 1995 - 2010 across the US and the health status of those who smoke.

## Keywords:

Disease, Health, Tobacco Use, National Health Data

## Introduction:

Tobacco is a plant that contains nicotine, which can lead to addiction. Tobacco use can cause serious health problems for users. Different tobacco products have different levels of health risk to users. For example, cigarettes are the most harmful, while e-cigarettes can be less toxic. Smoking is also the most common form of tobacco use in the world. However,  all tobacco products are considered harmful to people. Smoking causes cancer, brain stroke, diabetes, and many other diseases. The economic costs of tobacco use are substantial. Tobacco also contributes to poverty worldwide as tobacco users spend their money on products instead of basic needs such as food and shelter. In order to show the harm of tobacco and find ways to control tobacco use, our project collects and analyzes data on tobacco use trends, the tobacco industry, and tobacco-related diseases. We hope to find effective ways to reduce the demand for tobacco through the project.

## Problem Domain:

### Framing: What is the problem domain or design situation? What are the scientific, cultural, social, governmental, or economic issues or questions?

Tobacco harm is one of the serious public health problems in the world today. Numerous scientific evidence shows that smoking and second-hand smoke seriously harm human health. According to the World Health Organization statistics, the number of deaths due to smoking is as high as 6 million every year in the world. Substantial evidence shows that smoking can lead to multi-site malignancies, other chronic diseases, reproductive and developmental abnormalities, and other diseases and health problems. Smoking is a significant risk factor for infections like pneumonia, heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), and multiple cancers (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, bladder cancer, and pancreatic cancer). _(Health effects of tobacco 2022)_

Another governmental issue is the fact that the tobacco revenue is pretty high because tobacco has certain medicinal value, the number of smokers is large, and the tobacco industry is very profitable. So, the tobacco industry is difficult to restrict. The government signed a series of laws to reduce tobacco harm; for example, Engrossed House Bill 1074 was signed into law in March 2019, raising the minimum legal sales age of tobacco and vapor products to 21 years. _(Laws and regulations 2022)_ But tobacco sales remain high.

### Human values. What human values are within or connected to your problem domain? Where do the values originate? What value tensions among different values are present?

Many people believe that smoking tobacco is a right and freedom. In today's fast-paced society, smoking allows many people to relax. Smoking can regulate a person's mood by releasing stress. In addition, many people think smoking is a trend, a fashion, and a way to extend social relationships.

### Stakeholders. Who are the direct stakeholders of your topic of interest? What skills are assumed? What motivations and values do they hold? And, who are the indirect stakeholders?

The direct stakeholders of our topic are the victims of smokers and the potential people whose health may be influenced by tobacco. A variety of carcinogens in tobacco smoke can cause mutations in critical genes in the body, triggering the imbalance of the standard growth control mechanism of cells, resulting in cancerous cells. The data provided in this proposal can make people aware of the dangers of smoking.

Indirect stakeholders are governments and tobacco merchants. By presenting statistics related to tobacco and health, these topics can be brought to society's attention; thus, the government can prompt relevant government departments to formulate applicable laws to regulate the industry and promote the harmfulness of smoking. The tobacco industry can control tobacco production and adjust the industrial structure.

### Benefits and harms. If interventions are taken with data and technology, what are the potential benefits and harms? Which stakeholders are likely to benefit and be harmed? What unanticipated consequences might occur?

For benefits, if people realize the health effect of tobacco, it would significantly reduce the number of patients sickened by tobacco. There will also be fewer people smoking secondhand smoke, and many streets will no longer smell smoke.
However, there are also some harms for the government, whose tax revenue will be reduced by reducing tobacco sales. According to a dataset provided by Statista Research Department, in 2021, revenues from tobacco tax in the United States amounted to 12.14 billion U.S. dollars. The forecast predicts a decrease in tobacco tax revenues to 11.28 billion U.S. dollars in 2027. _(Published by Statista Research Department & 30, 2022)._ In addition, For tobacco merchants, a drop in sales reduces their income. Furthermore, a small number of people who want freedom from smoking might object to this policy. They might cause more chaos and affect other people.

## Research Questions

### What’s the trend of tobacco use across the US? For example, which state/area has the most tobacco users compared to other states.

This question is essential because once we know about the national tobacco use trend, we can understand the overall population of smokers across the country. It also reflects the policies of how the government controls tobacco in different states. By knowing this information, we can find better ways to create policies to control tobacco use.

### Has the number of tobacco users grown over the years?

This question shows how much tobacco users have grown to discover the severe problem. By looking at the growth, we can get an idea of how many people are affected by tobacco and if more people are starting to get affected.

### How do the average glucose level, BMI, and age compare for brain stroke patients who smoke or never smoke.

This question is essential because tobacco use can cause severe brain stroke and many other diseases. However, it’s possible to prevent those tobacco-related diseases if it’s at an early stage. By finding the trend of brain stroke patients’ smoking status, we hope that more people can get to know the crucial problems of smoking and prevent such diseases.

### Which country produces the most tobacco? Why?

This question is vital because tobacco production in countries can reflect the number of tobacco users. More production means more smokers. This question raises the problem to a global level. It can also show the trend of tobacco users around the world. By answering this question, we hope to find ways to control better and restrict the tobacco industry.

## Data Set

There are a table to display. ![three datasets](https://github.com/info201b-au2022/project-Wyd912263554/blob/main/docs/Table.png) we used that are related to our problem domain, the data set about Tobacco Industry, the data set about Tobacco use between the year 1995 to 2010, and the data set about brain stroke. Since we are talking about how smoke affects people's health and how we can control the tobacco trend in our country, these data sets are essential. _(Aché, Mathurin, 2020)_

The data set about Tobacco Industry showed the production of unprocessed tobacco by country/region in 2000. Even though America was the fourth on the list, it still produced about 408 thousand tons of tobacco. And that is just the data from 20 years ago; with the advancement of technology, America can probably produce way more than 408 thousand tons of tobacco a year. This data can help solve our research question because this proves how much the tobacco industry weighs in our country.

The provenance of the dataset: It was created by the Kaggle user Mathurin Aché 2 years ago, and Mathurin Aché extracted the dataset from the Tobacco industry's Wikipedia. The author shows no fund or purpose, and there is no citation even on the Wikipedia page for the dataset, so I don't think it's credible and trustworthy. I found the dataset by searching on the Kaggle website, and since the source of the dataset is Wikipedia, I don't trust the source. _(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016)_

The data set about Tobacco use between 1995 to 2010 filters out people who smoked into four levels: never smoked, former smoker, smoke some days, and smoke every day. The data includes data from 1995 to 2010, and about everywhere in America and territories like the Virgin Islands are included. According to the data, most places in America have about 40 to 50 percent of people have experience with tobacco. This data can help solve our research question because this proves that tobacco use is a massive problem in America since there is a large portion of people who use tobacco in each state.

The provenance of the dataset: It was created by the Kaggle user Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 6 years ago, and the purpose of it is to show tobacco trends in the United States. The Centers probably provide the collecting fund for Disease Control and Prevention, and I don't think this data is for profit-making. The data is collected and protected by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which is credible and trustworthy since it is from the CDC. I found the data set by searching on Kaggle, and I trust the source of the data. _(Tech, Jillani Soft, 2022)_

The data set about Brain Stroke has smoke as a critical variable as a cause of brain stroke. Most of the volunteers in the data set are not smokers, and there according to the data, most of the volunteers have not had a brain stroke. This data can help solve our research question because this proves smoking might cause brain stroke.

The provenance of the dataset: It was created by the Kaggle user Jillani Soft Tech 3 months ago, and he made the data to warn people about the danger of brain stroke. There is no funding showing, and the data source is unknown. I found the data set by searching on Kaggle, and I don't trust the source since the author did not cite the original anywhere.

## Implications:

In answering our questions regarding tobacco **production, usage, and effects,** we expect **_significant changes from the ground up regarding tobacco regulations surrounding both presentations, as well as restrictions on use._** Suppose we can effectively show connections between countries that produce and consume tobacco the most being a significant influencer of adverse health and economic outcomes. In that case, there will be grounds for **future policies to be implemented against smoking.** While technologists and designers may be trying to promote the usage of their tobacco products as safe and recreational, it could very well be with little to no results. In the aftermath of more of tobacco’s adverse effects and correlations being uncovered, it would not be surprising to see policymakers from _governments to health officials_ cracking down on both tobacco production and consumption, ultimately leading to a smaller market for the public tobacco industry and the possibility for more of a surge of unauthorized tobacco trade as demand would drive suppliers to unethical practices out of desperation so move product.

## Limitations:

While this study looks to bring light to tobacco usage numbers and trends using as many data-driven methods as possible, there are still underlying **_limitations_** that could impact the study/results. The most obvious and impactful limitation of this study is the possibility of innate **correlation bias** in an effort to show tobacco production consumption. Another limitation that needs to be addressed could be the **time relevance** of our data. The data sets we analyzed ranged from _1995-2010, over ten years ago._ It would have to be noted that the trends drawn from our data could be irrelevant now due to advancements in technology from the end time of our data sets to now regarding both tobacco production, forms of consumption, as well as medical advances.
