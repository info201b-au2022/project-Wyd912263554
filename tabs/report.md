## Abstract:

Our main question is how tobacco use affects people and how we can control the demand for tobacco in the country. This question is vital because the tobacco epidemic is one of the biggest public health threats that we're facing. To address this question, we will analyze datasets containing tobacco use trends of adults, tobacco industry, and tobacco consumption in US and the smoking status of those who smoke.

## Keywords:

Adult smoking status, Tobacco Use, National Data, tobacco consumption.

## Introduction:

Tobacco is a plant that contains nicotine, which can lead to addiction. Tobacco use can cause serious health problems for users. Different tobacco products have different levels of health risk to users. For example, cigarettes are the most harmful, while e-cigarettes can be less toxic. Smoking is also the most common form of tobacco use in the world. However, all tobacco products are considered harmful to people. Smoking causes cancer, brain stroke, diabetes, and many other diseases. The economic costs of tobacco use are substantial. Tobacco also contributes to poverty worldwide as tobacco users spend their money on products instead of basic needs such as food and shelter. In order to show the harm of tobacco and find ways to control tobacco use, our project collects and analyzes data on tobacco use trends, the tobacco industry, and adults tobacco consumption. We hope to find effective ways to know tobacco comprehensively through the project.

## Problem Domain:

### Framing: What is the problem domain or design situation? What are the scientific, cultural, social, governmental, or economic issues or questions?

Tobacco harm is one of the serious public health problems in the world today. Numerous scientific evidence shows that smoking and second-hand smoke seriously harm human health. According to the World Health Organization statistics, the number of deaths due to smoking is as high as 6 million every year in the world. Substantial evidence shows that smoking can lead to multi-site malignancies, other chronic diseases, reproductive and developmental abnormalities, and other diseases and health problems. Smoking is a significant risk factor for infections like pneumonia, heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), and multiple cancers (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, bladder cancer, and pancreatic cancer). *(Health effects of tobacco 2022)*

Another governmental issue is the fact that the tobacco revenue is pretty high because tobacco has certain medicinal value, the number of smokers is large, and the tobacco industry is very profitable. So, the tobacco industry is difficult to restrict. The government signed a series of laws to reduce tobacco harm; for example, Engrossed House Bill 1074 was signed into law in March 2019, raising the minimum legal sales age of tobacco and vapor products to 21 years. *(Laws and regulations 2022)* But tobacco sales remain high.

### Human values. What human values are within or connected to your problem domain? Where do the values originate? What value tensions among different values are present?

Many people believe that smoking tobacco is a right and freedom. In today's fast-paced society, smoking allows many people to relax. Smoking can regulate a person's mood by releasing stress. In addition, many people think smoking is a trend, a fashion, and a way to extend social relationships.

### Stakeholders. Who are the direct stakeholders of your topic of interest? What skills are assumed? What motivations and values do they hold? And, who are the indirect stakeholders?

The direct stakeholders of our topic are the victims of smokers and the potential people whose health may be influenced by tobacco. A variety of carcinogens in tobacco smoke can cause mutations in critical genes in the body, triggering the imbalance of the standard growth control mechanism of cells, resulting in cancerous cells. The data provided in this proposal can make people aware of the dangers of smoking.

Indirect stakeholders are governments and tobacco merchants. By presenting statistics related to tobacco and health, these topics can be brought to society's attention; thus, the government can prompt relevant government departments to formulate applicable laws to regulate the industry and promote the harmfulness of smoking. The tobacco industry can control tobacco production and adjust the industrial structure.

### Benefits and harms. If interventions are taken with data and technology, what are the potential benefits and harms? Which stakeholders are likely to benefit and be harmed? What unanticipated consequences might occur?

For benefits, if people realize the health effect of tobacco, it would significantly reduce the number of patients sickened by tobacco. There will also be fewer people smoking secondhand smoke, and many streets will no longer smell smoke. However, there are also some harms for the government, whose tax revenue will be reduced by reducing tobacco sales. According to a dataset provided by Statista Research Department, in 2021, revenues from tobacco tax in the United States amounted to 12.14 billion U.S. dollars. The forecast predicts a decrease in tobacco tax revenues to 11.28 billion U.S. dollars in 2027. *(Published by Statista Research Department & 30, 2022).* In addition, For tobacco merchants, a drop in sales reduces their income. Furthermore, a small number of people who want freedom from smoking might object to this policy. They might cause more chaos and affect other people.

## Research Questions:

### What's the trend of tobacco use across the US? For example, which state/area has the most tobacco users compared to other states.

This question is essential because once we know about the national tobacco use trend, we can understand the overall population of smokers across the country. It also reflects the policies of how the government controls tobacco in different states. By knowing this information, we can find better ways to create policies to control tobacco use.

### Has the number of tobacco users (adults) grown over the years? And what is the proportion of different tobacco type?

This question shows how much tobacco users have grown to discover the severe problem. By looking at the growth, we can get an idea of how many people are affected by tobacco and if more people are starting to get affected. Addtionally, we can find the preference of people's tobacco use.

### How much economic value can the tobacco industry generate?

This question can reply to the economic value created by tobacco and why it is hard to prohibit smoking around the world.

### Which country produces the most tobacco? Why?

This question is vital because tobacco production in countries can reflect the number of tobacco users. More production means more smokers. This question raises the problem to a global level. It can also show the trend of tobacco users around the world. By answering this question, we hope to find ways to control better and restrict the tobacco industry.

## Data Set

We found one of our dataset from this [website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/tobacco-use) posted on Kaggle. This data set about Tobacco use between 1995 to 2010 filters out people who smoked into four levels: never smoked, former smoker, smoke some days, and smoke every day. The data includes data from 1995 to 2010, and about everywhere in America and territories like the Virgin Islands are included. According to the data, most places in America have about 40 to 50 percent of people have experience with tobacco. This data can help solve our research question because this proves that tobacco use is a massive problem in America since there is a large portion of people who use tobacco in each state.

The data set about [Tobacco Industry](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/tobacco-industry) showed the production of unprocessed tobacco by country/region in 2000. Even though America was the fourth on the list, it still produced about 408 thousand tons of tobacco. And that is just the data from 20 years ago; with the advancement of technology, America can probably produce way more than 408 thousand tons of tobacco a year. This data can help solve our research question because this proves how much the tobacco industry weighs in our country.

Additionally, we use the [national adult tobacco data](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Survey-Data/National-Adult-Tobacco-Survey-NATS-/tbfm-vbpp) to find out their smoking status in U.S. NATS was designed as a stratified, national, landline, and cell phone survey of non-institutionalized adults aged 18 years and older residing in the 50 states or D.C. It was developed to yield data representative and comparable at both national and state levels. The sample design also aims to provide national estimates for subgroups defined by gender, age, and race/ethnicity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).

Furthermore, we explore the data of [tobacco consumption in U.S](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Policy/Adult-Tobacco-Consumption-In-The-U-S-2000-Present/rnvb-cpxx) to find the economic values of tobacco industry. Adult Tobacco Consumption in the U.S. This dataset highlights critical trends in adult total and per capita consumption of both combustible (cigarettes, little cigars, small cigars, pipe tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco) tobacco products and smokeless (chewing tobacco and snuff) tobacco from 2000 to present (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021).

The provenance of the dataset: It was created by the Kaggle user and the purpose of it is to show tobacco trends in the United States. The Centers probably provide the collecting fund for Disease Control and Prevention, and I don't think this data is for profit-making. What's more, the rest of our data is credible and trustworthy since it is from the CDC.

## Implications:

In answering our questions regarding tobacco **production, usage, and effects,** we expect ***significant changes from the ground up regarding tobacco regulations surrounding both presentations, as well as restrictions on use.*** Suppose we can effectively show connections between countries that produce and consume tobacco the most being a significant influencer of adverse health and economic outcomes. In that case, there will be grounds for **future policies to be implemented against smoking.** While technologists and designers may be trying to promote the usage of their tobacco products as safe and recreational, it could very well be with little to no results. In the aftermath of more of tobacco's adverse effects and correlations being uncovered, it would not be surprising to see policymakers from *governments to health officials* cracking down on both tobacco production and consumption, ultimately leading to a smaller market for the public tobacco industry and the possibility for more of a surge of unauthorized tobacco trade as demand would drive suppliers to unethical practices out of desperation so move product.

## Limitations:

While this study looks to bring light to tobacco usage numbers and trends using as many data-driven methods as possible, there are still underlying ***limitations*** that could impact the study/results. The most obvious and impactful limitation of this study is the possibility of innate **correlation bias** in an effort to show tobacco production consumption. Another limitation that needs to be addressed could be the **time relevance** of our data. The data sets we analyzed ranged to *2021, one year ago.* It would have to be noted that the trends drawn from our data could be irrelevant now due to advancements in technology from the end time of our data sets to now regarding both tobacco production, forms of consumption, as well as medical advances.

## Findings:

What's the trend of tobacco use across the US? For example, which state/area has the most tobacco users compared to other states. Most smoking everyday population in states across the U.S. has decreased from 1995 to 2010. It's interesting that there are a couple of peaks from most states from 2000 to 2003. We observed that Kentucky had the most tobacco users compared to other states. We also noticed that eastern states tend to have more smoking population than western states in the U.S. The middle part of the U.S. has the most smoking population. I think it's due to the urbanicity of certain areas. Urban areas have less smoking population than rural areas.

What's the trend of adult tobacco use by age groups? We concluded that cigarettes are the main use of tobacco among adults in the U.S. Smokeless tobacco is the second main use of tobacco. Cigars have the least population compared to other tobacco types. People between 18 to 24 tend to use tobacco more than other age groups between 2013 - 2014. We can conclude that younger people use tobacco more often. Older people use cigarettes more while younger age groups use e-cigarettes and hookah use more often. Only people older than 45 use tobacco by pipe.

How do the average glucose level, BMI, and age compare for brain stroke patients who smoke or never smoke. According to the brain stroke data, the average glucose level, BMI, and age for brain stroke patients are much higher compared to people who don't have brain stroke. The average age for brain stroke patients is about 68 while 42 for people without brain stroke. The average statistics are also higher for patients who smoke compared to people who never smoke. Therefore, there's a higher chance for people to get a brain stroke if they smoke.

Which country produces the most tobacco? Why? According to the tobacco industry data, China produces the most tobacco in the world with an amount of 2298.8 thousand tons of tobacco produced. More than 80% of the tobacco leaf production produced in China is used for domestic cigarette production. China produces the most tobacco because tobacco can contribute lots of tax and economic gain to the government in China. The cigarette industry is also one of the biggest industries in China. Therefore, the government can ignore the negative health impact of smoking.

## Discussion:


## Conclusion:

To sum up, this project focuses on four research questions to explore the current situation of the tobacco industry. To show the audience more intuitively, we have adopted three interactive charts for data visualization.

From the perspective of tobacco production in various countries, China, which tops the list, far exceeds other countries. It is because of China's large population that the tobacco industry can flourish in China. Therefore, **demand determines supply.** Profitability is an important reason why the tobacco industry is difficult to ban around the world.

Judging from the trend of smoking population in each state in the United States, tobacco smoking is on the decline. The overall trend of all states has increased since 1995. It's interesting to find that there are couple of peaks from 2000 to 2003. We also noticed that eastern states tend to have more smoking population than western states in the U.S. For everyone's health, this is a good trend, because it not only saves them tobacco spending, but also effectively reduces the harm caused by tobacco to the human body.

At the same time, as the smoking population declines, the tobacco consumption industry is also showing a downward trend. According to the different measures of combustible tobacco products, whether it is cigarettes or other tobacco products, a clear downward trend can be seen. This can also reflect a key point: **the market determines supply and demand.** When the smoking population declines, the tobacco consumption will undoubtedly be affected. Combined with the propaganda that smoking is harmful to health by the government and many organizations in recent decades. We can feel that modern people's awareness and concept of the right to maintain their own health has been significantly improved compared with the past.

Additionally, cigarette is the main use of tobacco. People between 18 to 44 tend to use tobacco more than other age groups. Cigar use is the tobacco type with the least population. Also, older people use cigarettes more while younger age groups use e-cigarettes more often. Take e-cigarettes as an example, thanks to its novel and convenient way of smoking, many students on campus prefer it very much. Although e-cigarettes contain less nicotine than traditional cigarettes, it does not mean they are harmless. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)---are emerging products receiving considerable advocacy, policy, and media attention. ENDS have been marketed as harm-reducing alternatives to smoking and used as cessation aids, though the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not reviewed these claims or devices (Pearson et al., 2012). Therefore, we still have to be wary of these new trends in the cigarette industry.

In conclusion, after the exploration of tobacco use and industry, the factors that associated with tobacco are complex. The key point is: **tobacco harms health, everyone should take responsibility for their tobacco use.**
