# The Cause and Impact of Widespread Tobacco Use in the Country

## Introduction

Tobacco is a plant that contains nicotine, which can lead to addiction. Tobacco use can cause serious health problems for users. Different tobacco products have different levels of health risk to users. For example, cigarettes are the most harmful, while e-cigarettes can be less toxic. Smoking is also the most common form of tobacco use in the world. However, all tobacco products are considered harmful to people. Smoking causes cancer, brain stroke, diabetes, and many other diseases. The economic costs of tobacco use are substantial. Tobacco also contributes to poverty worldwide as tobacco users spend their money on products instead of basic needs such as food and shelter. In order to show the harm of tobacco and find ways to control tobacco use, our project collects and analyzes data on tobacco use trends, the tobacco industry, and adults tobacco consumption. We hope to find effective ways to know tobacco comprehensively through the project.

## Major questions

**1. What's the trend of tobacco use across the US? For example, which state/area has the most tobacco users compared to other states.**

**2. Has the number of tobacco users grown over the years?**

**3. How do the average glucose level, BMI, and age compare for brain stroke patients who smoke or never smoke.**

**4. Which country produces the most tobacco? Why?**

**5. How much economic value can the tobacco industry generate?**

## Data We Use

We found one of our dataset from this [website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/tobacco-use) posted on Kaggle. This data set about Tobacco use between 1995 to 2010 filters out people who smoked into four levels: never smoked, former smoker, smoke some days, and smoke every day. The data includes data from 1995 to 2010, and about everywhere in America and territories like the Virgin Islands are included. According to the data, most places in America have about 40 to 50 percent of people have experience with tobacco. This data can help solve our research question because this proves that tobacco use is a massive problem in America since there is a large portion of people who use tobacco in each state.

The data set about [Tobacco Industry](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/tobacco-industry) showed the production of unprocessed tobacco by country/region in 2000. Even though America was the fourth on the list, it still produced about 408 thousand tons of tobacco. And that is just the data from 20 years ago; with the advancement of technology, America can probably produce way more than 408 thousand tons of tobacco a year. This data can help solve our research question because this proves how much the tobacco industry weighs in our country.

Additionally, we use the national adult tobacco data to find out their smoking status in U.S. Furthermore, we explore the data of tobacco consumption in U.S to find the economic values of tobacco industry.

The provenance of the dataset: It was created by the Kaggle user Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 6 years ago, and the purpose of it is to show tobacco trends in the United States. The Centers probably provide the collecting fund for Disease Control and Prevention, and I don't think this data is for profit-making. What's more, our data is credible and trustworthy since it is from the CDC.

## Implications:

In answering our questions regarding tobacco production, usage, and effects, we expect significant changes from the ground up regarding tobacco regulations surrounding both presentations, as well as restrictions on use. Suppose we can effectively show connections between countries that produce and consume tobacco the most being a significant influencer of adverse health and economic outcomes. In that case, there will be grounds for future policies to be implemented against smoking. While technologists and designers may be trying to promote the usage of their tobacco products as safe and recreational, it could very well be with little to no results. In the aftermath of more of tobacco's adverse effects and correlations being uncovered, it would not be surprising to see policymakers from governments to health officials cracking down on both tobacco production and consumption, ultimately leading to a smaller market for the public tobacco industry and the possibility for more of a surge of unauthorized tobacco trade as demand would drive suppliers to unethical practices out of desperation so move product.

## Limitations:

While this study looks to bring light to tobacco usage numbers and trends using as many data-driven methods as possible, there are still underlying limitations that could impact the study/results. The most obvious and impactful limitation of this study is the possibility of innate correlation bias in an effort to show tobacco production consumption. Another limitation that needs to be addressed could be the time relevance of our data. The data sets we analyzed ranged from 1995-2010, over ten years ago. It would have to be noted that the trends drawn from our data could be irrelevant now due to advancements in technology from the end time of our data sets to now regarding both tobacco production, forms of consumption, as well as medical advances.
